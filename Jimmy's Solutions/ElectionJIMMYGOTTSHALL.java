/** *  Election.java (Lab 3.7 Direction) *  @author Lewis/Patel *  @version 9.12.08 * *   This file contains a program that tallies the results of *   an election.  It reads in the number of votes for each of *   two candidates in each of several precincts.  It determines *   the total number of votes received by each candidate, the *   percent of votes received by each candidate, the number of  *   precincts each candidate carries, and the  *   maximum winning margin in a precinct. */import java.util.Scanner;public class ElectionJIMMYGOTTSHALL{    /**     *	main method-     *  @param args     */    public static void main (String[] args)    {        int votesForPolly;  // number of votes for Polly in each precinct        int votesForErnest; // number of votes for Ernest in each precinct        int totalPolly;     // running total of votes for Polly        int totalErnest;    // running total of votes for Ernest        char response;      // answer ('y' or 'n') to the "more precincts" question        int winsP=0;        int winsE=0;        int ties=0;        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);        System.out.println ();        System.out.println ("Election Day Vote Counting Program");        System.out.println ();        // Initializations        totalPolly=0;        totalErnest=0;        // Loop to "process" the votes in each precinct        do {        System.out.println("Votes for Polly: ");        votesForPolly=scan.nextInt();        totalPolly+=votesForPolly;        System.out.println("Votes for Ernest: ");        votesForErnest=scan.nextInt();        totalErnest+=votesForErnest;        System.out.println("more precincts?
